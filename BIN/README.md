FIRE2.EXE: My attempt at fire simulation. In dosbox, use control-F12 liberally to get realistic speed.

NEURO.EXE: Some simple neural networks experiments.

PLASMA33.EXE: A burning point in fire should follow the mouse cursor, and clicking the mouse causes more "burn". In practice, dosbox seems to support mouse button only.

PLASMA6.EXE: A demo effect with burning things, my favorite. See video recording here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwVobPCi6Hg

TURBO.EXE: A really old version of Borland Turbo Pascal. Borland has released this free of charge for the purposes of historical interest, so
I guess it is ok to share it here. I bought this with my lawnmowing money, 800 Finnish marks at the time directly from Borland.
We also used this in our high school in Kurikan Yl√§aste, but the version they had was an older one. I am really grateful for Borland
for releasing such a quality SDK for a price that even a kid could afford.

VERKKO4.EXE: A kind of a finite difference method, showing how heat propagates into a network of elements. The center pixel is rotated at
a constant speed, and spring equations are used to propagate acceleration to neighbors.

FIRE2.EXE: My attempt at fire simulation. In dosbox, use control-F12 liberally to get realistic speed.

NEURO.EXE: Some simple neural networks experiments.

PLASMA33.EXE: A burning point in fire should follow the mouse cursor, and clicking the mouse causes more "burn". In practice, dosbox seems to support mouse button only.

PLASMA6.EXE: A demo effect with burning things, my favorite.

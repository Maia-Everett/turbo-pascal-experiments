These can be run with dosbox with for example `dosbox SPACE.EXE`.

For more realistic performance matching the system at the time,
you should press control-F12 a couple of times to speed up the emulation.

Most programs can be exited by pressing ESC.

== Some picks

COOL.EXE: Some palette manipulation with squares.

COOLIMAT.EXE: A bouncing worm-like effect, again with palette manipulation.

GOUKUUT2.EXE: A wireframe cube with one side gouraud shaded. Press a,s,d and z,x,c to control.

GOUKUUT.EXE: The same without wireframe, and a palette not tuned to shade properly.

KUUT2.EXE: Just a wireframe 3D cube with the same controls as above.

KUUTIO.EXE: A kind of a cube with the vertices moving in a weird fashion.

NIRVA.EXE: A colorful effect with a filled rectangle with corners bouncing symmetrically.

PALLOT.EXE: Lots of bouncing, colored pixels.

PURKAA.EXE: A weird tool for automatically extracting certain archives such as ARJ, RAR and ZIP.
It was a time before we had WinZIPs or such.

RAVIT2.EXE: This was a race betting game I made. Use arrow keys and space bar to choose option.
The points race in a random walk fashion, and the results are printed in the end.
We made bets against each other with this. My little brother made the menu picture.

RAVIT.EXE: The same as the previous without the menu screen.

SPACE.EXE: A simple solar system simulation with chained trigonometric functions.

SPIR2.EXE: A colorful spiral effect. Again, use control-F12 liberally for a realistic speed.

SYDAN3.EXE: A 3D rotating heart with palette manipulations.

TAHTIA4.EXE: This is a 3D starfield with palette shading.

This was my entry at the seventh grade in the challenge posed by our compoter class instructor:
"Do what you can, I will grade accordingly". For this the teacher said:
"Well, it takes a while to see how it goes", and gave me the grade 7/10.
Students who drew pictures of the teacher using Paintbrush
(the previous equivalent of PC Paint) got 10/10.

VAREJA.EXE: An experimental effect of randomly increasing the color index of certain pixels. Again, control-F12 is a must.
